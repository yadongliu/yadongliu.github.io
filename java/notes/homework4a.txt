In this homework, you are asked to install Android Studio.
This will probably take 1 - 2 hours.

We have been using Sublime Text for editing our Java source code. While it
is a very nice editor, it does not provide any debugging tools. As your
Java program becomes more complicated you will need a propper IDE 
(aka Integrated Development Environment). 

Popular IDE for Java programming include:
- Eclipse (open source and free): one of the oldest Java IDE.
- Intellij IDEA (commercial): one of nicest Java IDE but it is not free. You could apply for a free license for student on their website.
- Android Studio (free): this is based on IntelliJ but provided by Google as a free download. 
The best feature is that it is nicely integrated with Android SDK etc. The downside is that 
you won't be able do non-Android development. For that, your free option would be Eclipse.

We don't have a lot of time practice using Android Studio. My hope is that you can install 
Android Studio on your own out of the class. We will then use Android Studio 
for 1 or 2 programming demos during Saturday's class. After the summer camp is over,
you will be able to use Android Studio to write more code. 


Here are the stps you need to perform. If you have into any problems, do not panic. Try Google 
to find a fix for your problem.

1. Download Android Studio

2. Install Android Studio on Windows or Mac

3. Launch Android Studio 

Very Important Note: on Windows laptops, you need to run Android Studio as Administrator.

To run an application one time with a full administrator access token:

    Locate the program icon or a shortcut in Windows Explorer.
    Right-click the program icon or shortcut, and then click Run as administrator.
    When the UAC message is displayed, do one of the following:
        If you are logged on as a standard user, or if UAC is configured to always require credentials, enter the appropriate administrative credentials, and then click OK.

        If you are logged on as an administrator and UAC is not configured to always require credentials, click Yes to start the application.

4. Install the latest Android SDK.

http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Setting_up_a_Windows,_Linux_or_Mac_OS_X_Android_Studio_Development_Environment#Installing_the_Latest_Android_SDK_Packages

In the Android SDK Manager window, at least select the following Packages to install:

1. Tools
(but not the Preview channel)
2. Android 5.1.1 (API 22)
3. Android 4,4,2 (API 19)
4. Android 4.0 (API 14)
5. Additionally, under the Extras package, select:
- Android Support Repository
- Android Support Library
- Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)

5. Install HAXM

You should have downloaded HAXM from the last step. Now you need to go to your Android SDK
folder, navigate to folder: extras/intel, and run the HAXM installer.
