Getting Stock Quotes From Yahoo!


During the summer camp, you already learned how to retrieve a text file from the Internet.
Now you can use that knowledge to write your own stock quote tool. 

For some background information, a public company's stock is identified by a so-called
stock symbol, which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 letters. For example, Google's stock symbol is
GOOG; and Facebook's is FB

You can concat the base url "http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=" and stock symbol "FB" to create
the url to fetch a stock quote page. 

Try it in your favorite browser: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB

You will write a Java class called StockQuote.java that takes one argument (which is a stock symbol)
and prints the stock price to the terminal.

So after you are done, you should be able to do:

Compile:  javac StockQuote.java
Run:      java StockQuote FB

Some more notes to help you tackle the problem.

Obvisouly you can do this in steps:

Step 1 would be retrieve the html file from a given url. 
(html file is just a plain text file with html tags: http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/whatishtml.php)
So naturally you can use a String object to store the retrieved html file. 


Step 2: parse the returned html String object and look for tags that encloses information you
are interested in. 

For example, if you open http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB in your browser and view its Source 
(In Chrome, you can do View->Developer->View Source)

You will find that the following section contains the Company name that corresponds with the stock symbol 'FB':

<title>FB: Summary for Facebook, Inc.- Yahoo! Finance</title>

So to write a simple string parser to return the company, I could do:

   // Given symbol, get current stock name.
   public static String name(String html, String symbol) {
       int p    = html.indexOf("<title>", 0);
       int from = html.indexOf("Summary for ", p);
       int to   = html.indexOf("- Yahoo! Finance", from);
       String name = html.substring(from + 12, to);
       return name;
   }


Step 3: You are going to write a parser to return stock price. 

Use FB as an example again, here is relevant section of text you would need to search for and parse:

<span id="yfs_l84_fb">98.39</span>

98.39 is the price of Facebook's stock on Tuesday, July 21, 2015.
